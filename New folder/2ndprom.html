		<p align="justify">Bangladesh is a land of mystery and intrigue. The country is centuries old and while it has seen many visitors 		over the years, it is only now starting to experience a commercial tourism boom.</p>

		<p align="justify"> In many respects, Bangladesh is a land of opportunity and adventure. All you need do is step out and discover 		its many mysteries for yourself.</p>

		<p align="justify">There are so many things to be enjoyed here. Perhaps one of the most popular activities is that of sunning 		yourself on the exquisite white sandy beaches of Cox’s Bazaar and Teknaaf.</p.

		<p align="justify> Both beaches are situated on the eastern coast of the Bay of Bengal and are relatively unspoilt by tourists 		making them a great place to spend vacation time. Another attraction is the many archaeological sites in the country.</p>

		<p align="justify> They are interesting from a cultural and architectural point of view and can be fascinating to tour. Bangladesh’s 		other attraction is a bit more lively – the Royal Bengal Tigers which have become somewhat of a trademark for the country. 				These stunning big cats are somewhat protected in the country and are stunning to behold!</p>

		<p align="justify">Bangladesh is also home to the longest sea beach, the largest tea gardens and some amazing exotic animal life. To 		top it off, the people of the country are colorful and friendly and have a fascinating culture. There is a lot to do 				here.</p>

		<p align="justify"> You can choose things such as trekking and adventure tours. Most of the activities give you the opportunity to 		take in the beautiful green mountains, sparkling rivers and clear vistas. The natural wealth of the area is, in many respects, 		unbeatable. Bangladesh is a paradise just waiting to be discovered!</p>
